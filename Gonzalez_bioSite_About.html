                <p>Aref Moshayedi is someone that upon meeting you immediately seem to be drawn to. He has always had a passion to him and calmness that invites you to have a conversation with him. Upon further discussion, you come to learn that he is reserved
                    and has a charming demeanor. </p>
                <p>Having known Aref since high school, I've seen him blossom and change into the person he is today. he has always had an interest in expressing himself creatively as well as being studious. Our bond first grew through our mutual interest
                    in graphics design since we met in our computer graphics course in high school. Ever since then, our friendship has flourished and grown into what it is today. What I first noticed about aref was how he gave a different "vibe" than
                    anyone else i'd met thus far. It was refreshing and piqued my interest. I quickly came to understand and know that he enjoyed playing uno with friends and I was pulled into playing with him many times.
                </p>
                <p>Now, Aref has adopted a well put together color palette to his wardrobe which is greatly influenced by his interests. He has an outfit I like to call the "palm tree" look since it consists of tan pants and a shirt with palm tree leaves.
                    That's how I would best describe Aref. A walking plant lover.</p>
                <p>Aref is almost finished with his medical school program and is currently working on his residency applications, he has been busy with all of the paperwork that comes with the applications- but it will all be worth it.</p>
                <span class="sentence">Here's to Aref's choice of residency in sunny San Diego!</span>
